# Succulent Monitor
In contrast to the high-maintenance leafy plants, succulents are the low-maintenance rock stars of the botanical world. They can survive on minimal watering, which often leaves us wondering, "Is the soil too dry or just right?"<br> That's where the sensor system steps in, giving your green pals a voice to tell you,<b> "Hey, it's time for a drink!"

>🌱 Temperature | </b>15-21°C(60-70°F) is ideal. <br>
🌱 Position | </b>Stand indoors with good natural light, avoiding the midday sun in summer. <br>
🌱 Watering | </b>Keep the compost lightly moist, but do not overwater or allow it to stand in water.  

## Board and sensors  
- Feather Huzzah ESP8266 Wi-Fi  
- Raspberry Pi 4
- UCL CASA Plant Monitor Shield
- DHT22: environment temperature, humidity  
- Nail Soil Sensor: soil moisture  

## Process
![process](./img/process.png)   
### Build: Setting up environments(Wifi&Time)  
- [Testing](./testwifi_tz) Wi-Fi with ESP8266
- Setting Timezone (GB)
- Solder up CASA Plant Monitor shield
  
### Sensor: Testing sensors and collecting data  
- [Testing](./testDHT22) DHT22 and collecting environment data
- [Testing](./testMoisture) Nail Soil sensor and collecting soil data  
 `(pot size, nails: depth in soil, texture of nails, type of soil, distance between nails)`
 
### Connect: Connecting and publishing data to MQTT  
- [Sending](./testMQTT) Data to MQTT (Publish topics: temperature, humidity, moisture)       
  ![mqtt](https://github.com/sjosk/Plantmonitor/blob/main/testMQTT/Sending%20Soil%20Data%20to%20MQTT02.png?raw=true)
  
### Store: Setting up the gateway and storing data  
- Setting up Raspberry Pi as a gateway
- [Install](./testInfluxDB_Telegraf_Grafana) InfluxDB, Telegraf, Grafana
- Setting InfluxDB and Telegraf to capture the data from MQTT topics.
- Create Databases and Raspberry Pi System Dashboard  
 `(Token Permission)`
  
### Visualize: Times Series Database Visualization  
- Visualising Data on Grafana
   ![grafana](./testInfluxDB_Telegraf_Grafana/Grafana.png)
  
- Create [testing](./testWeb/webv0.png) web monitor application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## What's next?  
>I focus on the connection between plants, people, and sensors (computers).  
>How do we monitor and send data notifications when people and plants are not in the same space?   

In process: 
- [Webhook](./testNotifications) with Arduino: try to interact with the plant (debugging)
- adding speaker/neo pixel with plant
- Interactive website  ([practise](https://github.com/sjosk/Plantmonitor/tree/main/testWeb/3D%20Web))
